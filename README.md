# Fetch-Take-Home-Test

This program reads from a CSV file called transactions.csv in the current working directory and accepts a single argument. 

To run:
Open terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is saved.
Run the following command: python pointsItems.py [amount_of_points_to_spend]. For example, to spend 5000 points: python pointsItems.py 5000.
The program requires a CSV file named "transactions.csv" in the same directory as the code. The file should contain transaction data in the format outlined in the prompt, with each row being a separate transaction and the columns being "payer", "points", and "timestamp".
The program outputs a dictionary of payer balances after spending the specified number of points, according to the rules outlined in the prompt.
